# Delphi 11.3 JsonMapper's between Record

The Delphi Json Mapper Record is a native RTL technique from Delphi 11 Alexandria generating units for the record, which allows dynamic conversion between JSON structures and records.

ðŸ“Œ Main Features:
âœ… Dynamic JSON Mapping: Allows for automatic parsing and generation of records from arbitrary JSONs, without having to manually define each field.
âœ… Bidirectional Conversion: Provides methods to serialize and deserialize JSONs to records using TJSONMarshal and TJSONUnMarshal.
âœ… Support for Different JSON Types: Recognizes various types such as jtObject, jtArray, jtString, jtNumber, jtDate, jtDateTime, etc.
âœ… Delphi Code Generation: Provides methods to generate Delphi source code with mapped records, facilitating integration into projects.
âœ… Customization by Attributes: Can use [JSONReflect] to control the mapping of specific fields when necessary.
âœ… Use of RTTI: Dynamic parsing is done through RTTI, allowing access and manipulation of types at runtime.
